The emphasis is on practical database experience reinforced through assignments and weekly laboratory work. Students learn first to work with a workstation-based database system and subsequently they are introduced to the design of databases and their implementation in relational systems. Topics include tables, queries, forms, reports, importing and exporting data, structured query language, entity relationship models, the relational data model, and normalization of databases. Examples, assignments, and laboratory work are drawn from a variety of different disciplines. ",
